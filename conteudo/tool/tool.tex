Our proposed tool is a Command Line Interface (CLI) software, the tool purpose is to enable developers to query 
information about code clone duplication in a function level, by function level we mean to find functions in a codebase that 
are code duplications. The tool is separated in two steps. The 
first one, denoted as Setup, is executed only once for each codebase and it is responsible for processing the
codebase doing tasks such as extracting functions of the code files 
and searching for code clone duplications. The second step, denoted as Query Responder, is
responsible to execute the tool functionalities using the information obtained in the Setup step. More information about the 
Setup and Query Responder behavior can be found in \ref{subsec:architecture} and in \ref{subsec:func}.
