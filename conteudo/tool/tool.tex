Our proposed tool is a Command Line Interface (CLI) software. Its purpose is to enable developers to query 
information about code clone duplication at the function level, which means finding pairs of functions in a codebase 
that are code clones of each other. 

The tool operates in two steps. The first step, called Setup, is executed only 
once for each codebase and is responsible for processing the codebase by extracting functions from code files and 
searching for code clone duplications. The second step, called Query Responder, executes the tool's functionalities 
using the information obtained in the Setup step. More information about the Setup and Query Responder behavior can 
be found in sections \ref{subsec:architecture}  and \ref{subsec:func}.
