On this Chapter, we exposes our experiment results bout the proposed tool performance following
the methology described in Chapter \ref{cha:method}. Firstly, we shows the results obtained by our tool
in the BigCloneBench dataset\citep{bigclonebench}, which is the standard form of the formal literature 
\citep{litreview}. Secondly, we shows the results obtained by our tool on the empirical analyses. 
Finaly, we do a triangulation of data analysing our finds on the tool performance.

The results were obtained by randomly selecting ten functions in the AMD Display driver for 
each similarity range and analyzing if they are duplications and which duplication type.
